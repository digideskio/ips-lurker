The last thing on your mind: |
  Don't think too hard if you think it hurts that bad
  Don't talk about it; don't let it get you down!
  It's only one part of the story
  Just let it go; don't let it bring you down now

  Sing the last thing on your mind!
  The last word on your breath!
  I'll be the one to keep you!
  I'll be the one to keep you one disaster less!

  Straighten up your tie, take the microphone
  Forget about it, don't let it get you down!
  Now is not the time and you're not alone
  I'll be okay! I'll be okay if you...


I Owe You One: |
  What you've given me is more than I can say!
  'Cause I don't know the words to thank you properly
  You pulled me from the grave and stood me on a hill
  When I was afraid, you made me still

  For the love You bring
  Owe You everything!
  For the breath You give
  You're my cause to live
  For everything under the sun, I owe you one

  Chaos all around! Explosions and fire!
  You took me off the ground and lifted me higher!
  Now I'll never be the same.

White: |
  Are there oceans full of things you'll never say?
  Are there skylines of the cities you don't see?
  Is there music muted playing underneath?
  Is mathematics keeping you from thinking free?

  Do you see lights? Turn your shadows white!
  Do you see lights?
  Turn your shadows white!

  Don't let rain clouds cry at all of your parades
  Let the other side of darkness kiss your face
  Into the sea! Into the sea.
  All the things I want to say...
  All the shadows in the way...

February Air: |
  If you don't believe me, if you don't like my plans
  We walk the city
  How I know your face like the back of my hand

  My arms get cold in February air!
  Please don't lose hold of me out there!

  Say that you're with me
  Say you know my face like the back of your hand


Drive my Soul: |
  Seems somebody put out the moon
  Now the road is a minefield
  I can't follow the way she moves
  I can't see past the shadows
  You make the darkness disappear!
  I feel found when you stand near
  I know where I am when you are here!
  My way becomes so clear...

  When you're gone, will I lose control?
  You're the only road I know!
  You show me where to go!
  Who will drive my soul?

  Seems somebody burned up the signs
  Where there's no borders, there are no lines!
  You make the street lights reappear!
  I feel bright when you stand near
  I know what I am when you are here!


River: |
  Out across cities, I see buildings burn into piles.
  And watch the world in wonder as mountains turn into tiles
  And trees losing their leaves, and our faces becoming tired
  I wish I could discover something that doesn't expire!
  Come and stumble me!

  Take me river; carry me far!
  Lead me, river, like a mother!
  Take me over to some other unknown!
  Pull me in the undertow.

  Such are the things that make a kingdom rumble and shatter
  The same dynamic that another day would never matter
  Things that don't make sense are always a little deceiving

  I wanna go where you're going!
  A follower following!
  Changing but never changed!
  Claiming but never claimed!


Ice: |
  My mouth is frozen so I can't even speak!
  What a disappointment, I had it perfectly!
  What I was going to bring up suddenly
  Stood like a stone as you stood quietly
  You're making it hard for me! All I can do is freeze!

  What I mean is all I need is just a little emotion
  'Cause all I see is you not feeling
  And you're giving me nothing nice!
  I tried to do you right. Why'd you have to go and turn to ice?

  I don't think you're knowing how hard this is for me
  I'm not the type to say sorry constantly
  So I swallowed my pride and I got on my knees
  But still you just stood there as you stared at me
  Your ego is getting old! How did you get so cold?

  I'm looking at you looking at me, what can I do but say sorry?
  It's a little late but you know I just want you to be happy!
  What I got to say to make you let me get away with it this time?
  I know you're upset and that you're happy just to sit and hate me!
  But I'll make a bet that you'll be better to forget about me!
  Even better yet, I'll let a little light melt the ice, ice baby!


Saviour: |
  The night is deafening when the silence is listening
  I'm down on my knees, and I know that something is missing.
  I'm a bit of a manic when it's not as I plan it
  'Cause I start losing my head and then I get up in a panic
  Are we denying a crisis or are we scared of admitting it?
  I don't want to know

  I just want to run to you
  And break off the chains and throw them away!
  I just want to be so much
  And shake off the dust that turned me to rust!
  Sooner than later, I'll need a saviour!
  Save me!

  It won't ever change if you want it to stay the same
  Stand me up and maybe I won't be so small!
  Free my hands and feet and maybe I won't always fall...


The Listening: |
  Please excuse me. I'm not thinking clear.
  It must just be stress but I likely shouldn't be here!

  I never really ever know what to say
  I'm just trying to get us on the same page
  I always get it better right afterwards
  When all the wrong impressions are said and heard
  How come I can never get the right words I need to convey?

  I don't feel right
  Can I let the trees do the talking?
  Can I let the ground do the walking?
  Can I let the sky fill what's missing, and...
  Can I let my mouth do the listening?


Pretend: |
  Once in a while, I act like a child
  It gets like a prison in the body I'm living in

  It would be nice to start over again before we were men
  Let's play pretend
  I'd give, I'd bend, let's play pretend

  Remember the times we had soda for wine?
  And we got by on gratitude.
  The worst they could do to you was check your attitude
  When fights were for fun, we had water in guns
  How we lost hold of home, I guess I'll never know.
  And when it's the end, our lives will make sense
  It's not going to be long before we're all gone
  Stop taking lives; come on, let's all grow up again!

Second Go: |
  How many times will the clock go around?
  How many times can my hands hit the ground?
  How many coffins before there's a crown?
  How far will I fall 'til the alarm sounds?
  How can you love me when I am ugly?
  Guess I can only hope

  Give me a second go!
  Don't let me go alone!
  You saw me at the worst, You caught me falling first!

  No matter the weather there's never a break!
  Conquer a ladder then slip on a snake!
  Cried 'til my river turned into a lake!
  I'm wondering now before it's too late
  How come you save me when I am angry?
  Reasons I'll never know
  One to five I'm half alive!
  Six to nine I'm out of line.
  Ten to twelve I'm not myself by the millionth time I cry.


Face Up: |
  It's late and I am tired!
  Wish I could spark a smile.
  The place is flying high but right now I want to be low
  Don't want to move an inch, let alone a million miles!
  And I don't want to go but I know I've gotta go
  I just want to feel alive!

  The times you don't want to wake up
  'Cause in your sleep it's never over when you give up
  The sun is always going to rise up
  Look at the people all around you!
  The way you feel is something everybody goes through.
  Dark out, but you still gotta light up!
  You need to wake up, gotta keep your face up!

  Seems like the more you grow, the more time you spend alone
  Before you know it you end up perfectly on your own
  The city's shining bright, but you don't see the light!
  How come you concentrate on things that don't make you feel right?

  I'm looking for more than a little bit
  I'm gonna have to find my way through it
  Gonna leave a mark, I'm gonna set a spark
  I'm coming up off the ground!
  I won't be looking down.

Lions: |
  Give me a disaster!
  Give me emergency!
  Stand me at the head of the crusade without a remedy!
  Show me to the shipwreck!
  Show me how your bones shake!
  And when I'm at the edge of Sorrow's Blade
  Show me how a heart breaks!
  Be steady on your feet
  No matter the trouble you meet

  Lions make you brave
  Giants give you faith
  Death is a charade
  You don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid

  Find me at the bottom looking at the vultures
  Standing in the heart of the disease
  I'm looking for the thunder
  I'm looking for the blackness
  I'm learning how to get up off my knees
  All it takes is practice
  I'm not the hunter, I'm not the marked
  Just looking for wisdom in the dark.


Quiet: |
  I'm not yours and you're not mine
  We can sit and pass the time
  No fighting wars, no ringing chimes.
  We're just feeling fine.
  This is where we're supposed to be
  Sitting by a broken tree
  No tragedy, no poetry
  Just staring at the sky

  I could wait a thousand hours
  Stay the same in sun and showers
  Pick apart a hundred flowers
  Just to be quiet

  Tell me when you feel ready
  I'm the one, there's not too many
  Hold my hand to keep me steady
  Just to be quiet with you

  I like it here beside you dear
  You're even more than you appear
  And in the clouds my head is clear
  Every time you say hello
  So here's my heart and here's my mouth
  I can't help if things come out
  'Cause there are words I want to shout
  But maybe I'll stay low...

Up Up and Away: |
  We had a rocket that fell out of orbit
  We couldn't stop it; we couldn't control it
  We ran a good course. It was a good flight.
  But I felt a hard force holding me too tight!

  We are rockets in the sky!
  We are planets passing by!
  Up up and away!
  Forget me; go your own way.

  Sometimes a heart cools after the heat goes.
  And sometimes the mind fools; only the body knows

My Boots: |
  You might know if you're from around here
  What goes on for half of the year
  Have you seen the Queen of the Castle?
  Paint this city from ear to fear
  If the air was meant to be glitter
  It might not take all yours away
  When she swings, she's a heavy hitter!
  When she comes, you'll ask her to stay!

  Winter left a cover that I'm gonna end up under
  I've got my boots
  When I'm in a summer I forget how much I love her
  It's a love-hate romance
  'Cause I could watch her dance if I've got my boots!

  A love-hate romance, I can't feel my hands
  I got on my boots; got my boots on!
  My boo-oo-oo-oo-oots!
  Something in the way she comes gliding
  Makes me need to fix up the hair!
  She gets me to come out of hiding
  And find something decent to wear!
  Stop and stare...


Jess and Jonny: |
  The car will get us there so you don't have to wait.
  We'll drive, not walk, 'cause I know that you hate...
  I love your face, your hair, regardless of your mood
  We learn to talk it over 'til it's smooth
  It really makes you brave, but we do it all the time
  And I love you 'cause you're mine

  So talk to me and make me feel fine!
  I hope you can all the time
  Forgive me if I'm ever on a knee
  Kiss me if you're mad at mommy
  Love me even if I'm a mess!
  Take me as I am bad or best!
  Love me even if I'm a mess! Take me as I am bad or best!
  Jonny loves Jess!

  There are a couple things - we don't always agree
  On what to watch or what we're going to eat
  But I'm willing to change for the sake of me and you
  'Cause I know you're changing too
  I try to think of how my life would probably be
  Without you, I would feel so unhappy
  'Cause you balance me out
  You're the minus to my plus
  You're the minus to my plus when it's just the two of us!

Romace Is: |
  You're three sides of my eight-sided circle
  Two lovers juxtapose red doorways.
  Broken window frames colour her eyes in with black lines
  Let it all run down...
  There's no explanation or forewarning
  Underneath all the crimson linings
  We approach the streets with the clear conscious we'll survive

  It's one way to opt for a horizon
  It's one way to say we're abandoned
  And we don't belong here at all
  and romance just is

  Slow it all down, the damage is done
  Play the music loud, don't make a sound
  Let's raise a toast to a sad story!
  You made it hurt so bad
  With a little poison, we can burn this whole place down
  Burn this whole place down to the ground again
# Note that the "opt for a horizon" line is hard to understand. t

# thanks Elamind
Pity scene: |
  I've come to realize that you've made up too many excuses
  and I've come to see that I'm in this alone
  You were only there when you wanted and I'm delirious
  I'm at my wits end, and you're ignorant to refuse it
  I don't understand why I'm in this alone.
  Where's your heart in this matter?
  Where's your hear--wha...?! oh wait I'm in drop D...
  Black turns gray; ahead, ahead...
  I played my part, if it matters
  It's clear that I care too much today.
  I care too much today
  sorry I was in drop D for that one
  and I hope you're hearing this


# thanks Elamind
Casanova: |
  Cheap words falling out of your teeth
  He heard, she heard, you heard me once
  With a love gone sour
  I've lost my appetite
  There's no more flavor
  In talking sweet, now fix it somehow
  Don't Casanova me
  I'm over you; it's over obviously
  Don't put your sugar on me!
  It's too late to sweeten this baby
  Hey Casanova, it's over!


Year of the Cure: |
  Are we all radicals painting our own lines?
  Not at all practical, wasting our time?
  Always going, never knowing
  Give us a place to go where we can be found.
  We're out of time to keep being lied to.

  We all need to find a dream
  We all dream about love
  Cause these are the things we know for sure
  To live without love is not what we're for
  We'll make it the year we find the cure

  So here we go heart and soul
  Ready to burn down
  I know I'm not ready to go home
  No not when there's work to be done

# thanks susanxteasley
Cactus in the Valley: |
  I never meant to wither, I wanted to be tall
  Like a fool, I left the river and watched my branches fall
  Old and thirsty, I longed for the flood to come back around
  To the cactus in the valley; it's about to crumble down

  Wipe the mark of sadness from my face!
  Show me that Your love will never change!
  If my yesterday is a disgrace
  Show me that you still recall my name

  So the storm finally found me and left me in the dark
  In the cloud around me, I don’t know where You are
  If this whole world goes up in arms, all I can do is stand
  And I won’t fight for anyone until You move my hands

  Wipe the mark of madness from my face!

  Oh here, in the shadow; here I am.
  And I need someone by my side!
  It becomes so hard to stand and I keep trying to dry my eyes
  Come and find me in the valley...
  Tell me that You'll still recall my name.


Perfect: |
  Maybe I don't say all the right things
  Maybe I stumble on my words
  Maybe I laugh at all the wrong times
  Maybe I mumble and I curse
  The last thing I want is to let you down
  'Cause all I want is to make you proud!
  But I'm perfect for you.
  I can't explain just why I'm acting this way!
  I can't control it, so I go with it.
  I'm just a girl; I won't be changing the world.
  And boy you know that I'm not perfect.
  But I'm perfect for you!
  I know I don't make all the best moves
  And I know sometimes I get weak
  But I know I've got nothing to prove
  Baby, that's what you love about me
  The best I can do is to be myself
  When you're in the room, my head is clear
  And you'll make a world just disappear
  Open up your eyes and see

Siberia: |
  From the busy parks to the icy tides
  Someday, we'll decide where we want to live out our lives
  For now, we're two sparks tumbling along
  Keeping the heat on even though summer's come and gone

  I would sail across the east sea
  Just to see you on the far side
  Where the wind is cold and angry
  There you'll be to take me inside
  We'll find ways to fill the empty
  Far from all the hysteria
  I don't care if we suddenly find ourselves in Siberia!

  Inside a street car or on a mountain trail
  Details, details; you breathe in when I exhale
  No matter where we are or which way the wind blows
  Or how heavy the snow, nothing can change where we will go

  We'll leave Canada for Siberia

Where the Fence is Low: |
  Where the fence is low and the water is rising
  And the fire comes down
  And the dark fills the skies in
  One foot on the ledge and I'm feeling for safety
  Somewhere between sure, and I don't know; maybe...

  I'm off of my rope here! I'm off on my own here!
  I find my hope here. I find my own here.
  I'm off of my rope here where the fence is low

  Each shadow I walk, to the ends of the forest
  In the shape of the hands that break the ground for us
  The fear that contains; that binds like a blessing
  I've been here before, then again I'm guessing...

# Like a magpie and a ring,
Toes: |
  If you are a cliff hanger ending
  I'm the one that doesn't know anything
  I am always gonna be looking right to you

  Oh, you capture my attention!
  Carefully listening! Don't wanna miss a thing!
  Keeping my eyes on you!
  Got me on my toes...

  If I were to hide out on the sea
  You'd be whispering from the westerlies
  In any book I'll ever read
  you'd be the line that sticks out to me


Banner: |
  Maybe it's bricks and mortar now
  Whether or not they run it down
  I don't want anything to shake that shape away
  No one told us which way to come
  Nobody mapped oblivion
  So I go growing roses in the disarray

  Just like most, falling head in
  'Til my ghost fills the bed in

  So lift it up like a banner!
  Hold it up over me!
  If this war is never ending...
  I'll take this love down with me

  I don't need fate to give it time
  It doesn't take pain to change your mind
  No weapon can sever the soul from me

  Not the sorceress, not the money
  All my cleverness, all my cunning

  It's around me in my surroundings
  It counts me when it starts the counting
  In the chaos, there is a standard
  I'm carrying it like a banner

Heavy Rope: |
  Strange hands taking my wrist again
  Somehow, I'm still alone
  Voices shaking my steps again.  I follow.
  I'm a little bit on the edge.
  Hold up and out of reach
  I can't hear much of what you said

  Come for me! Don't let me tumble away!
  Into the throws of the shadowy bay
  I cling to the rock and it's crumbling off
  Toss me a heavy rope! It's a slippery slope!

  Come bail me out of this God-forsaken precipice

  Turned up in this old place again
  Can't seem to get away....
  Take me back to my element; I'm afraid

  I'm not a lost cause. I'm just stuck in a spot.
  And I'm close to falling off, so toss me a heavy rope!

Timing is Everything: |
  You were walking in your sunset again without a hassle
  In the interim, the princess was in another castle
  Rolling different rocks, reverse days and nights
  In opposite towns, if we hadn't walked the same way
  Would I end up on your ground?

  There I was, none the wiser
  Both of us. Different trajectories!
  Who'd have thought we'd be right here?
  In this spot, timing is everything!

  Seems impossible to time it out right when you get no hints

  You don't know; you've got to trust
  It will go if you just roll with the punches
  Roll with the punches, your guts, and your hunches

Peace Sign: |
  If they take my hand, will it be to burn me or to say Amen?
  We beckon so we can make amends
  And with the same flip of the hand, we curse our friends

  When it's all a blur, you are the hard line
  In the disorder, you are the peace sign

  It's getting hard to know if I'm on the tracks
  When no truth ever easily shows
  So I'll follow you no matter where you go

  I can't tell if they're laughing at me or with me
  All these hints and subtleties
  They got me begging on my knees begging for serenity

Everybody Breaks a Glass: |
  It's not a solid, not a soft thing
  To pull the wool up like a smoke screen
  Nobody does it like a prophet
  It's gone before you know you lost it

  There are reasons you keep your hands tied
  There's certain things you shouldn't have tried
  So if you gotta tell me something, you better go from the beginning

  We all forget to sleep and crash at someone's feet
  Everybody skips a beat
  We let the chances pass the few we held so fast
  Everybody breaks a glass

  And here I'm standing in the middle
  Not just a little but a hill full
  Wondering how I got a head cold
  Wishing I didn't know what I know
  It's never been about the money
  We're worthy or we are not worthy

  However much you got on your plate
  You're as good as you reciprocate
  We all pretend to keep our tongue out of our cheek
  Everyone's the fool they seek
  We all go off the track, and feel for our way back
  Somewhere perfection lies, but not for you and I
  Everybody trips some time
  When cities fall like shacks, walls eventually crack


#Shock
#scared to look
#at peers when they peer back
#It’s weird how we fear that
#It’s weird how we wear masks
#It appears that we fear our own tears
#More than tear gas
#My team’s struggling in years past
#Looking to draft beers
#To bring cheers back
#But when the drinking game’s finished
#No Guinness- just a clear glass
#Seeing our real image mirrored back
#The places that we go to cope
#It’s so strange
#When we’re older folks
#It don’t change
#Trying to hang, we don’t know the ropes
#When we fall, we got more than our shoulders broke
#It’s no game
#It’s why we overdose on cocaine
#Get our brains comatose, there’s no blame
#If you’ve ever know shame
#Known pain
#Known days when it really don’t feel ok

Suspension: |
  Somewhere we go to kill a while
  A moment continuing for miles...

  Stars wed overhead; you're everywhere...
  Don't need anything as much.
  Soul shed on a thread, stranded in air...
  When you get too far to touch.

  I'm a ship sailing, and the seas are rough!
  I'm a satellite in the space above!
  When I'm holding here, where I'm hanging up...
  I'm in suspension. You're not close enough!
  You're not close enough.

  Then comes the sun, the solar flare...
  In the suspension: find me there.
  Lift my spirit high when you come here
  Enemy under the heel
  The sky feeling I get when you're near...
  I'd give up gravity to feel

Flux and Flow: |
  Well, I guess I lost this round.
  The mountains have come down.
  I won't go where they go.
  No, I'll be back around.
  I won't go where they go. No, I'll be back around.
  With our heads above the trees
  And the storm at our knees
  Come all the tides and tows, we'll stand above the sea!

  Highs and lows... There are pits and lands...
  On the ground that you stand.
  So flux and flow!
  Flux and flow, and you'll fix your plans.
  Then you'll trade in your hand.

  When we taste a bitter end and hunger life again...
  We take another turn with a better hand.

Fourth Dimension: |
  I could take steps in this moon and that cloud
  Look at my breath and still feel the warm out
  This isn't about seasons or about rhyme and reason

  Trying to be smart, but my Ohs and my Ones
  Only show stars in my toes and my thumbs
  Nothing adds up but agrees, you becomes us and makes three

  Cheers to such an old invention
  Dear, we touched the fourth dimension

  Bottle rockets and time bombs and warheads
  We could go back or keep on or be led
  Follow me to the chapel, we're the kings of the castle!

  It's a science, but there's room to believe
  In the riots, I find you and I breathe
  This isn't for the weak hearts
  But everyone's here at some part

  Here's an honorable mention

  I'm on moons and clouds where worlds wrap around

...And Counting: |
  Forty days and counting
  I'm going to sleep. When I wake up, there will be
  Thirty-nine more days left
  When I fall asleep, I feel you with me
  'Til I fall asleep and you are with me

  Thirty days and counting
  Twenty-nine more days left

  I'll stay right here. Up all night dear
  I'll stay right here 'till you're right here

# Thanks to Baushi for clarification

  All those sum-ups, long days, short cuts
  Love notes, strings struck
  Far-aways, close-ups
  Troubles test me. Time unrests me.
  But you kiss me; get the best of me

  We're just a mess of moments
  That's adding up to where we are
  And you're the frame and focus
  That's of making sense of it so far

  Fall back, scarecrow, in my marrow
  Shot an arrow through a sparrow
  I've crissed, I've crossed;
  I've kissed, and it's cost
  I've loved and I've lost, and I owe him a lot

  I'm not depressed or hopeless
  I'm only walking in a blur
  I'm the scene, you're the director

# if you get one of these, gratz.
"The Horror ( see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjK_ObeTzvo )": |
  Save me from the horror!
  I've been reading all of the wrong books
  Filling my head with the wrong scenes

Fall Back Down: |
  Don't worry about me, I'm gonna make it alright
  Got my enemies cross-haired in my sight
  Take a bad situation; gonna make it right
  In the shadow of darkness, I stand in the light.
  See, it's our style to keep it true
  Been knocked out beat down black and blue
  She's not the one coming back for you

  If I fall back down, you're gonna help me back up again
  If I fall back down, you're gonna be my friend

  It takes disaster to learn a lesson
  Gonna make it through the darkest night
  Some people betray one and cause treason
  Gonna make everything all right
  The worst of times now? They don't phase me
  Even if I look and act really crazy
  On my way down, you betrayed me
  Now my vision is no longer hazy
  I'm very lucky to have my crew stood by me when she flew

# You Got the Girl: |
# let's keep these out for now
# NOT PROOFREAD
#Hell, your grip is solid on me
#I'm delicate you know, I'm delicate I"m told
#Why can't you be careful with me?
#You never let me go, and I just can't say no
#'cause you are what I'm always missing
#what what can I do now
#I'm taken by you now
#
#you're sizing me up
#you're making me blush
#I'm not pretty enough
#
#I'm yours, hook and sinker,
#you know you win this round
#
#she's down, you're the winner this time,
#aren't you happy you got that girl
#I'm yours, song and singer, you know you won this round
#she's down, you're the winner tonight
#aren't you happy you got that girl

"Unicorn summoning song ( see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g43YQOm3lT0 )": |
  So bright the moon! So soft the breeze!
  I see silver horns beneath the trees!
  Come leap and twirl! Come tap and soar!
  There'll be dancing on the forest floor!

that stupid song Lights promised to cover: |
  I'd like to make myself believe
  Because my dreams are bursting at the seams
  Never gonna give you up! Never gonna let you down!
